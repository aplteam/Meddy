# Reference

The reference typically discusses the main goal(s) of a class and the parameters one can set.

It does not discuss single methods. Those are documented within the class scripts. You can view these
pieces of information with the help of the `]ADOC_browse` user command.

Example:

~~~
      ]ADOC-browse #.GUI.IE
