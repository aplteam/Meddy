# OnCloseForm

Syntax:

~~~
⍬ ← OnCloseForm msg
~~~

This callback saves the "Posn" and "Size" of the GUI control in case 
→[*.The_Windows_Registry|the registry keys are set].

"regKey" - if not empty - must specify a valid Windows Registry key to be used to save "Posn" and "Size".

This function will also set the global `∆closed` to 1; that's why this function is always
associated with the "Close" event, even when saving "Posn" and "Size" of the Form in question is
not required.
