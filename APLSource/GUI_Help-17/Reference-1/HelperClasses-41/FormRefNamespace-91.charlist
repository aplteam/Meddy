# The abc  "FormRefNamespace" class

Normally the namespace designated to store all references created by one of APLGui's main classes
(named n by convention) is created by `RefNamespace.Create`.

There are two exceptions: `StdForm` and `Dialogs`; they both create their `n` namespaces by calling
`FormRefNamespace.Create`. However, since the `FormRefNamespace` class inherits from the
`RefNamespace` class everything that's said for `RefNamespace` holds true for the
`FormRefNamespace` class as well.

`FormRefNamespace` just adds a method `âˆ†CloseForm` to the `n` namespace.
