# APLGuiParameterSpace

All APLGui's main classes (or GUI objects) store references and other stuff in a namespace which by
convention is called `n`. See the â†’[*.N_Namespace|`n` namespace] for details.

All those namespaces are created by calling `APLGuiParameterSpace.Create`.

The reason why it is not just a simple namespace is that it is populated with certain useful
methods by `APLGuiParameterSpace.Create`.
