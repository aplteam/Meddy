# ScreenEstate

Syntax:

~~~
r ‚Üê ScreenEstate
~~~

Returns the size of the screen that's available for an application.

Keep in mind that the result returned by the function is reliable only with a single monitor or
multiple monitors of the same size. The more multiple monitors differ in size the more useless the
value becomes.
