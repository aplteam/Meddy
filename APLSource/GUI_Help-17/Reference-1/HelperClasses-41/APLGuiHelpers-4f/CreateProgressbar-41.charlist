# CreateProgressbar

Syntax:

~~~
n ← CreateProgressbar n
~~~

Takes a namespace with references and adds a progress bar with the fixed name "Progressbar". That
namespace is also returned as result.

The right argument must be the parameters space of the parent Form. Only if the `hasProgressbar`
property is 1 is a progress bar actually added. Only if a form has a →[*.CreateStatusbar|statusbar] 
can a progress bar be added.
