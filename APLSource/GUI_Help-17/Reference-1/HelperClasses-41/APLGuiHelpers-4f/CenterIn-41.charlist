# CenterIn

Syntax:

~~~
{r} ‚Üê form1 CenterIn form2
~~~

Centers the form the reference `form1` is pointing to within `form2`. That works also on multiple
monitors and when `form2` is only partly visible. Naturally it does not work too well with
multiple monitors of different sizes.

Always returns an empty vector.
