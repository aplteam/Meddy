# CreateStatusbar

Syntax:

~~~
n ← CreateStatusbar n
~~~

Takes a namespace with references and adds a status bar with the fixed name "Statusbar". That
namespace is also returned as result.

The right argument must be the parameters space of the parent Form. Only if the `hasStatusbar`
property is 1 is a status bar actually added.
