# OptionsTool

This is the right tool if you want your user to select one item from or list (radio buttons; this is the default)
or zero to many items from a list (check boxes).

The list should not be long: it's not scrollable. For selections from long lists use `→[*.SelectionTool]` instead.

For implementation details execute:
