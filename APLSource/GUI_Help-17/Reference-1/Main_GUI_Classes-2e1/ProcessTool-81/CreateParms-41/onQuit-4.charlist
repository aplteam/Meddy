# onQuit

In case you want to return seomthing via `n.âˆ†results` you can specify a callback function for this.
This callback will be invoked when the user either closes the window or presses the button that by
default has a caption "Close".

The callback must accept a right argument (the `n` namespace) and may return a result. The result,
if there is any, must be a Boolean. A 1 allows the GUI to be closed down while a 0 prevents this.
