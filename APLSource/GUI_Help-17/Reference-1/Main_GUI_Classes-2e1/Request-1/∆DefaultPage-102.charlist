# Request
This class is useful to create very basic dialogs requesting a single piece of information.

Typical examples are:

~~~
AskForString 'Enter your name:'
AskForNumber 'Number of copies:'
~~~

Those functions are called →[Modal_helpers|"Helpers"].

For implementation details execute:

~~~
]ADOC.Browse #.GUI.Request'
~~~

What is →[*.ADOC]?
