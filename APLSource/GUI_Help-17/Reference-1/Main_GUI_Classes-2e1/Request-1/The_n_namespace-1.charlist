# The `n` namespace

The `n` contains all the usual stuff as →[*.N_Namespace|documented here].

In addition `Request`'s `n` namespace also contains:

`∆OK`

Boolean that is initialised with 0 and will become 1 only when the user presses the first button (Btn00).

`∆result`

This carries the input string (`AskString`) or number (`AskNumber`) or a date (`AskForData`) or a
password (`AskForPassword`) in case the "OK" button was pressed. Otherwise it is an empty vector.
