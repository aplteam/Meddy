# StdForm
The vast majority of the APLGui utilities use an instance of `StdForm`. The name stands for "Standard Form".
A form created by `StdForm.Create` comes with several useful features:

* There is a status bar with two fields. There is also a progress bar although it is invisible by default.
* Icon & caption are taken from general (=APLGui wide) parameters.
* "Size" and "Posn" are saved in the Windows Registry automatically if a key is provided.
* "Size" and "Posn" are restored when a key is provided and found in the Windows Registry.
* The programmer may define a minimum size.
* One can add buttons to the form simply by calling the `AddButtons` method.
* One can add tabs - including a fitting sub-form - to the form simply by calling the `AddTabs` method

Default appearance and behaviour can be changed of course.
