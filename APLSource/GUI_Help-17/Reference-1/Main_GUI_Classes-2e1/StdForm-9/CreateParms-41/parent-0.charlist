[DATA]:index='parent â‹„ owner'

# parent

By default a form created by `StdForm` is owned by `#`. You can change this by specifying the `parent` parameter which must be a reference
pointing to a Form.

By doing so you get around the problem that otherwise a small modal dialog box might disappear behind a bigger Form that is the main form of the application. 
The only way for the user to bring back the modal dialog is to select the associated window from the task bar. Not every user is aware of this.

This is a Dyalog problem, not an APLGUI problem. The only way to get around this is to make the modal dialog (any modal dialog) a child of the main Form. 
If the user clicks on the main Form all its children are brought to the front automatically.

It solves a second problem as well: in case the main form and a dialog form like "Are you sure?" are both visible and the user then moves a windows over
the dialog form then a click on the the main form (or the icon in the task bar representing the main form) won't bring the dialog form back into view
as you would expect unless the dialog box is a child of the main form.
