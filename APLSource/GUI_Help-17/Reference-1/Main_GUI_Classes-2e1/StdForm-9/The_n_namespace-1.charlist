# The "n" namespace

The `n` contains all the usual stuff as â†’[*.N_Namespace|documented here].

Since `StdForm` is used by almost all other APLGui main classes the `n` namespace of, say, a
`SelectionTool` instance is originally the `n` namespace created when `StdForm` is instantiated
but then other stuff is added to it.
