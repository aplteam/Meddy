# AddButtons

Syntax:

~~~
n ← AddButtons (n captions)
~~~

Useful to create one or more buttons on the form.

Note:

* The buttons created by this function will be added to the `n` namespace as references named `Btn_00`, `Btn_01` and so force.
* `n.∆buttons` is a vector that keeps references to all buttons created by `AddButtons`. This is useful for statements like `n.∆buttons.Active←0`
