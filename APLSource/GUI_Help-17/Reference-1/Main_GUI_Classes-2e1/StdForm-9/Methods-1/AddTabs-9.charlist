# AddTabs

Syntax:

~~~
n ← {posn} AddTabs (n captions)
~~~

Note:

* The tabs created by this function will be added to the n namespace as references named `Tab_00`, `Tab_01` and so force.
* Note that if you want to have both, tabs and buttons, on the form you must call `AddTabs` prior to `AddButtons`.
