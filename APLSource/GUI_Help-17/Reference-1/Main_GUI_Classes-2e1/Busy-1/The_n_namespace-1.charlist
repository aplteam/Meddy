# The `n` namespace

The n namespace contains all the usual stuff →[*.N_Namespace|as documented here].

In addition to that any `Busy` `n` namespace also contains a variable `∆ABORTED` which by default
is 0. If the user presses the "Abort" button then this variable becomes 1 as soon as the callback runs.
