# Smoothing

Most controls obey to the size of a standard row. Some might not due to their nature: Radio
buttons, check boxes and images.

For them the position is often slightly changed in an attempt to make them fit better into the
standard grid. This is explained best by an example. We use a group of radio buttons.

Note the gaping gap between the label and the group. The two controls, which are logically related,
are effectively separated dues to the space between them.

This is not only ugly, it is a serious usability issue. The following screen shot shows how it
actually looks like thanks to smoothing:

It is still not exactly brilliant, but it's much better.
