# Callback functions

How callback functions may be specified so that they can be found by `APLGui`
→[*.Callback_functions|was explained elsewhere].

Any callback can access the currently entered data by accessing `∆Result` in the
`n` namespace. `∆Result` has the same format as the result returnd by `Run`.
See "→[*.The_result]" for details.
