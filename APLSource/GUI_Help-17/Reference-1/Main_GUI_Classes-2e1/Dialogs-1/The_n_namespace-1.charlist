# The `n` namespace

The n namespace contains all the usual stuff →[*.N_Namespace|as documented here].

In addition to that any `Dialogs` n namespace also contains a variable `∆buttonPressed` which
originally will hold `⍬` as value but will hold a reference pointing to one of the main form
buttons as soon as the user presses the button.
