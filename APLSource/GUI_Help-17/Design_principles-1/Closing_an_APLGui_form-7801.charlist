# Closing an APLGui form

The official way to close an APLGui Form is to call the appropriate method which is `n.âˆ†CloseForm`.

Note that a GUI might continue to be visible; that's because somewhere it still a reference
pointing to the `n` namespace. Only when the last reference to `n` is deleted will the Form disappear.
