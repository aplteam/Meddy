# Errors

When APLGui runs into a problem or cannot accept a parameter then it will throw an error with
`âŽ•SIGNAL`. The number of the error is defined by the variable `APLGuiUtils.APLGuiError` except in
cases when the problem APLGui has run into is external.

A typical example would an access error when trying to read a file; in such cases the original
error is thrown of course.

If that number is not acceptable for you then just change that variable but keep in mind that an
update with a newer version of APLGui will potentially overwrite your change. Therefore, unless
you already use that very number, it's best to leave it as it is.
