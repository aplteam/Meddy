# Testing

Several dialogs offer help when it comes to testing a GUI application automatically.

The global `testMode` parameter defaults to 0.

If set to 1 **and** the `autoPress` is not `¯1` then methods like `YesOrNo` (and all the other
methods of the `→[*.Dialogs]` class) will honour the `timeout` parameter: a progressbar will be
shown and after `timeout` seconds  the button is pressed `autoPress` is pointing to unless the
user takes action.

Note that `timeout` defaults to .1 rather than 0 in case `testMode` is 1. That allows you to set
`timeout` on a global level for your application with a single assignment.

The button assigned to `autoPress` must come from `#.GUI.Enums.Buttons`.

## Actions triggered by push buttons

Note that all actions necessary to gain anything useful from a GUI object created by a constructor
of a main class are either executed as part of the OK button (`OnOkay`, as in the `SelectionTool`
class) or the `OnClose` callback as in the `Notepad` class. This is an important design goal
because only then can one build automated test cases for GUIs.
