⍝ * we can't.
⍝ * we don't know how.
⍝ * we are too lazy.

    ∇ r←AddToCaptionWidth
    ⍝ Calculating the size of the caption plus what's needed by Windows is a bit tricky,
    ⍝ to say the least: we don't know the font (!) and gaps between the button (min, max
    ⍝ etc) are VERY different between Windows 10 and older versions of Windows.
    ⍝
    ⍝ So we guess, and this vars is the best we can manage right now.
    ⍝ This is however not about the font, this is just about the min-max-close buttons
    ⍝ and the icon.
