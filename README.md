# Meddy

Meddy is a Markdown editor. It uses the [MarkAPL class](http://github.com/aplteam/MarkAPL) to convert Markdown to valid HTML5.

This is a Windows-only GUI application written in Dyalog APL 17.0 Unicode 32-bit which is available as a stand-alone EXE. 

Naturally Meddy is the only editor that supports all MarkAPL features.
